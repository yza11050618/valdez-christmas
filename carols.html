                  This Christmas carol has a long and elaborate history dating
                  all the way back to the Byzantine era of the 500s, with
                  origins in the Latin hymn, "Veni, Veni, Emmanuel."

                <p>
                  O Little Town of Bethlehem honors the birthplace of Jesus and
                  the nativity scene in the early Christian tradition. Bethlehem
                  is in current day Palestine, but back then was under Roman
                  rule.

                <p>
                  Originally a traditional African-American spiritual song,
                  Children, Go Where I Send Thee was first printed in 1936 but
                  the song likely dates back to sometime in the 17th or 18th
                  centuries.
